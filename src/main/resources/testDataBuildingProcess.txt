The data building process:


EmployeeBuilder
-----------------


preProcess the Table...

Look at the dispersements, 


start Building ...
determine how many to create
nRows: {
if this the main table then the user has decided
else {
	look at the 
	dispersement= nRows >= # of dispersement amounts
	data = nRows >= dataItems,
	self-ref with recursion=false = nRows >1
}
}

try to Building first nRows 

builds the first n rows without foreign-ref fields.

- call to the Mgr for these values from Dept Table

- the Mgr will send a request to the DeptTable for a set of nRows values from column (id)

- receives a Set containing nRows of values from DeptTable

- using the dispersement (none means dispersement = ['100%']) we divide the rows into sections 
each corresponding in size to the dispersement values.
- Then each section is has that foreign-ref field assign a value from the Set received from the DeptTable
  
- When ALL rows are completed they published to the listeners.
